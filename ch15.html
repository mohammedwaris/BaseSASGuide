  <p>You can execute SAS statements repeatedly by placing them in a DO loop. DO loops can
     execute any number of times in a single iteration of the DATA step. Using DO loops enables you
     to write concise DATA steps that are easier to change and debug.
  </p>
  <p>For example, the DO loop in this program eliminates the need for 12 separate programming
     statements to calculate annual earnings:
  </p>

  <pre>
  data finance.earnings;
     set finance.master;
     Earned=0;
     do count=1 to 12;
       earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>You can also use DO loops to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>generate data</li>
    <li>conditionally execute statements</li>
    <li>read data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This chapter shows you how to construct DO loops and how to include DO loops in your
     programs.

  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 1-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic1">Introduction</h3>

  <p>DO loops process a group of statements repeatedly rather than once. This can greatly reduce the
     number of statements required for a repetitive calculation. For example, these 12 Sum
     statements compute a company's annual earnings from investments. Notice that all 12
     statements are identical.
  </p>
  <pre>
  data finance.earnings;
     set finance.master;
     Earned=0;
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
  run;</pre>

  <p>Each Sum statement accumulates the calculated interest earned for an investment for one
     month. The variable Earned is created in the DATA step to store the earned interest. The
     investment is compounded monthly, meaning that the value of the earned interest is cumulative.
  </p>

  <p>A DO loop enables you to achieve the same results with fewer statements. In this case, the Sum
     statement executes 12 times within the DO loop during each iteration of the DATA step.
  </p>
  <pre>
  data finance.earnings;
     set finance.master;
     Earned=0;
     do count=1 to 12;
        earned+(amount+earned)*(rate/12);
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic2">General Form of DO Loops</h3>

  <p>To construct a DO loop, you use the DO and END statements along with other SAS statements.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>General form, simple iterative DO loop:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>DO</strong> index-variable=start <strong>TO</strong> stop <strong>BY</strong> increment;<br/>
     SAS statements <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>;
  </p>

  <p>where the start, stop, and increment values</p>
  <ul>
    <li>are set upon entry into the DO loop</li>
    <li>cannot be changed during the processing of the DO loop</li>
    <li>can be numbers, variables, or SAS expressions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The END statement terminates the loop</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="color-blue">Note</th>
      <td>The value of the index variable can be changed within the loop</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <hr/>

  <p>When creating a DO loop with the iterative DO statement, you must specify an index variable.
     The index variable stores the value of the current iteration of the DO loop. You can use any valid
     SAS name.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DO</strong> index-variable<strong>=start TO stop BY increment</strong>; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; <br/>
  </p>
  <p>Next, specify the conditions that execute the DO loop. A simple <strong>specification</strong> contains a <strong>start
     value</strong>, <strong>a stop value</strong>, and an <strong>increment value</strong> for the DO loop.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DO index-variable=start</strong> TO stop BY increment; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>;
  </p>
  <p>The start value specifies the initial value of the index variable.</p>
  <p><strong>DO index-variable=</strong>start <strong>TO stop</strong> BY increment; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; <br/>
  </p>
  <p>The TO clause specifies the stop value. The stop value is the last index value that executes the
     DO loop.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DO index-variable=start</strong> TO stop <strong>BY increment</strong>; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; 
  </p>

  <p>The optional BY clause specifies an increment value for the index variable. Typically, you want
     the DO loop to increment by 1 for each iteration. If you do not specify a BY clause, the default
     increment value is 1.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DO index-variable=start TO stop</strong> BY increment; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>;
  </p>

  <p>For example, the specification below increments the index variable by 1, resulting in quiz values
     of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:
  </p>
  <p><strong>do quiz=1 to 5;</strong></p>
  <p>By contrast, the following specification increments the index variable by 2, resulting in rows
     values of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12:
  </p>
  <p><strong>do rows=2 to 12 by 2;</strong></p>

  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 3-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic3">DO Loop Execution</h3>

  <p>Using the form of the DO loop that was just presented, let's see how the DO loop executes in the
     DATA step. This example calculates how much interest was earned each month for a one-year
     investment.
  </p>
  <pre>
  data finance.earnings;
     Amount=1000;
     Rate=.075/12;
     do month=1 to 12;
        Earned+(amount+earned)*(rate);
     end;
  run;</pre>
  <p>This DATA step does not read data from an external source. When submitted, it compiles and
     then executes only once to generate data. During compilation, the program data vector is created
     for the <strong>Finance.Earnings</strong> data set.
  </p>

  <img src="images/ch15_image1.png" class="diagram"/>

  <p>When the DATA step executes, the values of <i>Amount</i> and <i>Rate</i> are assigned.</p>
  <img src="images/ch15_image2.png" class="diagram"/>  

  <p>Next, the DO loop executes. During each execution of the DO loop, the value of <i>Earned</i> is
     calculated and is added to its previous value; then the value of <i>month</i> is incremented. On the
     twelfth execution of the DO loop, the program data vector looks like this:
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch15_image3.png" class="diagram"/> 

  <p>After the twelfth execution of the DO loop, the value of <i>month</i> is incremented to 13. Because 13
     exceeds the stop value of the iterative DO statement, the DO loop stops executing, and
     processing continues to the next DATA step statement. The end of the DATA step is reached, the
     values are written to the <strong>Finance.Earnings</strong> data set, and in this example, the DATA step ends.
     Only one observation is written to the data set.
  </p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red" colspan="4">SAS Data Set Finance.Earnings</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red">Amount</th>
      <th class="color-red">Rate</th>

      <td>13</td>
      <td>77.6326</td>
    </tr>
  </table> 
  <br/><br/>
  <p>Notice that the index variable <i>month</i> is also stored in the data set. In most cases, the index
     variable is needed only for processing the DO loop and can be dropped from the data set.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 4 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic4">Counting Iterations of DO Loops</h3>

  <p>In some cases, it is useful to create an index variable to count and store the number of iterations
     in the DO loop. Then you can drop the index variable from the data set.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.earn (drop=counter);
     Value=2000;
     do counter=1 to 20;
        Interest=value*.075;
        value+interest;
        Year+1;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <table>
    <tr>
       <th class="color-red" colspan="3">SAS Data Set Work.Earn</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <th class="color-red">Value</th>
       <th class="color-red">Interest</th>
       <th class="color-red">Year</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8495.70</td>
      <td>592.723</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>The Sum statement Year+1 accumulates the number of iterations of the DO loop and stores the
     total in the new variable <i>Year</i>. The final value of Year is then stored in the data set, whereas the
     index variable <i>counter</i> is dropped. The data set has one observation.
  </p>

  <h4>Explicit OUTPUT Statements</h4>

  <p>To create an observation for each iteration of the DO loop, place an OUTPUT statement inside
     the loop. By default, every DATA step contains an implicit OUTPUT statement at the end of the
     step. But placing an explicit OUTPUT statement in a DATA step overrides automatic output,
     causing SAS to add an observation to the data set only when the explicit OUTPUT statement is
     executed.
  </p>

  <p>The previous example created one observation because it used automatic output at the end of
     the DATA step. In the following example, the OUTPUT statement overrides automatic output, so
     the DATA step writes 20 observations.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.earn;
     Value=2000;
     do Year=1 to 20;
        Interest=value*.075;
        value+interest;
        output;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic5">Decrementing DO Loops</h3>

  <p>You can decrement a DO loop's index variable by specifying a negative value for the BY clause.
     For example, the specification in this iterative DO statement decreases the index variable by 1,
     resulting in values of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DO index-variable=5 to 1 by</strong> -1; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; <br/>
  </p>
   
  <p>When you use a negative BY clause value, the start value must always be greater than the stop
     value in order to decrease the index variable during each iteration.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DO index-variable=</strong>5 <strong>to</strong> 1 <strong>by</strong> -1; <br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; <br/>
  </p>

  <h4>Specifying a Series of Items</h4>
  <p>You can also specify how many times a DO loop executes by listing items in a series.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>General form, DO loop with a variable list:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>DO</strong> index-variable=value1, value2, value3...; <br/>
     SAS statements <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; <br/>
  </p>
  <p>where values can be character or numeric.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p>When the DO loop executes, it executes once for each item in the series. The index variable
     equals the value of the current item. You must use commas to separate items in the series.
  </p>
  <p>To list items in a series, you must specify either</p>
  <ul>
    <li>all numeric values <br/>
        <strong>DO index-variable=</strong>2,5,9,13,27; <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
        <strong>END</strong>;
    </li>
    <li>all character values, with each value enclosed in quotation marks <br/>
        <strong>DO index-variable=</strong>'MON','TUE','WED','THR','FRI';<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong><br/>
        <strong>END</strong>;
    </li>
    <li>all variable names- the index variable takes on the values of the specified variables <br/>
        <strong>DO index-variable=</strong>win,place,show; <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAS statements</strong> <br/>
        <strong>END</strong>;
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Variable names must represent either all numeric or all character values. Do not enclose variable
     names in quotation marks.

  <!-- Topic 3 -->
  <h2 class="topic" id="topic3">Nesting DO Loops</h2>

  <p>Iterative DO statements can be executed within a DO loop. Putting a DO loop within a DO loop is
     called <strong>nesting</strong>.
  </p>

  <pre>
  do i=1 to 20;
     SAS statements
     do j=1 to 10;
        SAS statements
     end;
     SAS statements
  end;</pre>

  <p>The following DATA step computes the value of a one-year investment that earns 7.5% annual
     interest, compounded monthly.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.earn;
     Capital=2000;
     do month=1 to 12;
        Interest=capital*(.075/12);
        capital+interest;
     end;
  run;</pre>
  
  <p>Let's assume the same amount of capital is to be added to the investment each year for 20 years.
     The new program must perform the calculation for each month during each of the 20 years. To do
     this, you can include the monthly calculations within another DO loop that executes 20 times.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.earn;
     do year=1 to 20;
        Capital+2000;
        do month=1 to 12;
           Interest=capital*(.075/12);
           capital+interest;
        end;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>During each iteration of the outside DO loop, an additional 2,000 is added to the capital, and the
     nested DO loop executes 12 times.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.earn;
     do year=1 to 20;
        Capital+2000;
        do month=1 to 12;
           Interest=capital*(.075/12);
           capital+interest;
        end;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>Remember, in order for nested DO loops to execute correctly, you must</p>
  <ul>
    <li>assign a unique index-variable name in each iterative DO statement.
        <pre>
        data work.earn;
           do year=1 to 20;
              Capital+2000;

    </li>
    <li>end each DO loop with an END statement
        <pre>

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic4">Iteratively Processing Data That Is Read from a Data Set</h2>
  
  <p>So far you have seen examples of DATA steps that use DO loops to generate one or more
     observations from one iteration of the DATA step. Now let's look at a DATA step that reads a data
     set to compute the value of a new variable.
  </p>
  <p>The SAS data set <strong>Finance.CDRates</strong>, shown below, contains interest rates for certificates of
     deposit (CDs) that are available from several institutions.
  </p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>

      <td>0.0814</td>
      <td>3</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Standard Pacific</td>
      <td>0.0806</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>Suppose you want to compare how much each CD will earn at maturity with an investment of
     $5,000. The DATA step below creates a new data set, <strong>Work.Compare</strong>, that contains the added
     variable, <i>Investment</i>.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.compare(drop=i);
     set finance.cdrates;
     Investment=5000;
     do i=1 to years;
        investment+rate*investment;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>The index variable is used only to execute the DO loop, so it is dropped from the new data set.
     Notice that the data set variable <i>Years</i> is used as the stop value in the iterative DO statement.
     As a result, the DO loop executes the number of times that are specified by the current value of
     <i>Years</i>. During the first iteration of the DATA step, for example, the DO loop executes five times.
  </p>

  <p>During each iteration of the DATA step,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>an observation is read from <strong>Finance.CDRates</strong></li>
    <li>the value 5000 is assigned to the variable <i>Investment</i></li>
    <li>the DO loop executes, based on the current value of <i>Years</i></li>
    <li>the value of <i>Investment</i> is computed (each time that the DO loop executes), using the
        current value of <i>Rate</i>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the bottom of the DATA step, the first observation is written to the <strong>Work.Compare</strong> data set.
     Control returns to the top of the DATA step, and the next observation is read from
     <strong>Finance.CDRates</strong>. These steps are repeated for each observation in <strong>Finance.CDRates</strong>. The resulting data set contains the computed values of <i>Investment</i> for all observations that have

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic5">Conditionally Executing DO Loops</h2>
 
  <p>The iterative DO statement requires that you specify the number of iterations for the DO loop.
     However, there are times when you want to execute a DO loop until a condition is reached or
     while a condition exists, but you don't know how many iterations are needed.
  </p>
  <p>Suppose you want to calculate the number of years that are required for an investment to reach
     $50,000. In the DATA step below, using an iterative DO statement is inappropriate because you
     are trying to determine the number of iterations required for <i>Capital</i> to reach $50,000.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
  data work.invest;
     do year=1 to ? ;
        Capital+2000;
        capital+capital*.10;
      end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>The DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements enable you to execute DO loops based on whether a
     condition is true or false.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 5 Subtopic 1-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic1">Using the DO UNTIL Statement</h3>

  <p>The DO UNTIL statement executes a DO loop until the expression is true.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>General form, DO UNTIL statement:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>DO</strong> UNTIL(expression); <br/>
     more SAS statements <br/>
     <strong>END</strong>; 
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>where expression is a valid SAS expression enclosed in parentheses.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p>The expression is not evaluated until the bottom of the loop, so a DO UNTIL loop always
     executes at least once. When the expression is evaluated as true, the DO loop is not executed
     again.
  </p>

  <p>Assume you want to know how many years it will take to earn $50,000 if you deposit $2,000 each
     year into an account that earns 10% interest. The DATA step that follows uses a DO UNTIL statement 
     to perform the calculation until the value is reached. Each iteration of the DO loop
     represents one year of earning.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.invest;
     do until(Capital>=50000);
        capital+2000;
        capital+capital*.10;
        Year+1;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>During each iteration of the DO loop,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2000 is added to the value of <i>Capital</i> to reflect the annual deposit of $2,000</li>
    <li>the value of <i>Capital</i> with 10% interest is calculated</li>
    <li>the value of <i>Year</i> is incremented by 1</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because there is no index variable in the DO UNTIL statement, the variable Year is created in a
     Sum statement to count the number of iterations of the DO loop. This program produces a data
     set that contains the single observation shown below. To accumulate more than $50,000 in
     capital requires 13 years (and 13 iterations of the DO loop).

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic2">Using the DO WHILE Statement</h3>

  <p>Like the DO UNTIL statement, the DO WHILE statement executes DO loops conditionally. You
     can use the DO WHILE statement to execute a DO loop while the expression is true.
  </p>

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>General form, DO WHILE statement:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>DO WHILE</strong>(expression); <br/>
     more SAS statements
     <strong>END</strong>;</p>
  <p>where expression is a valid SAS expression enclosed in parentheses.</p>
  <hr/>

  <p>An important difference between the DO UNTIL and DO WHILE statements is that the DO WHILE
     expression is evaluated at the top of the DO loop. If the expression is false the first time it is
     evaluated, then the DO loop never executes. For example, in the following program, if the value
     of <i>Capital</i> is less than 50,000, the DO loop does not execute.
  </p>
  <pre>
  data work.invest;
     do while(Capital>=50000);
        capital+2000;
        capital+capital*.10;
        Year+1;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <!-- Topic 6 -->
  <h2 class="topic" id="topic6">Using Conditional Clauses with the Iterative DO Statement</h2>

  <p>You have seen how the DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements enable you to execute statements
     conditionally and how the iterative DO statement enables you to execute statements a set
     number of times, unconditionally.
  </p>

  <p>DO WHILE(expression); <br/>
     DO UNTIL(expression); <br/>
     DO index-variable=start TO stop BY increment;
  </p>

  <p>Now let's look at a form of the iterative DO statement that combines features of both conditional
     and unconditional execution of DO loops.
  </p>

  <p>In this DATA step, the DO UNTIL statement determines how many years it takes (13) for an
     investment to reach $50,000.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.invest;
     do until(Capital>=50000);
        Year+1;
        capital+2000;
        capital+capital*.10;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red" colspan="2">SAS Data Set Work.Invest</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red">Capital</th>
      <th class="color-red">Year</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>53949.97</td>
      <td>13</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br/><br/>
 
  <p>Suppose you also want to limit the number of years that you invest your capital to 10 years. You
     can add the UNTIL or WHILE expression to an iterative DO statement to further control the
     number of iterations. This iterative DO statement enables you to execute the DO loop until
     <i>Capital</i> is greater than or equal to 50000 or until the DO loop executes 10 times, whichever
     occurs first.
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.invest(drop=i);
     do i=1 to 10 until(Capital>=50000);
        Year+1;
        capital+2000;
        capital+capital*.10;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red" colspan="2">SAS Data Set Work.Invest</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red">Capital</th>
      <th class="color-red">Year</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>35062.33</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>In this case, the DO loop stops executing after 10 iterations, and the value of <i>Capital</i> never
     reaches 50000. If you increase the amount added to Capital each year to 4000, the DO loop
     stops executing after the eighth iteration when the value of <i>Capital</i> exceeds 50000.
  </p>
  <pre>
  data work.invest(drop=i);
     do i=1 to 10 until(Capital>=50000);
        Year+1;
        capital+4000;
        capital+capital*.10;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>The UNTIL and WHILE specifications in an iterative DO statement function similarly to the DO
     UNTIL and DO WHILE statements. Both statements require a valid SAS expression enclosed in
     parentheses.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>UNTIL(expression)</strong>; <br/>
     DO index-variable=start TO stop BY increment <strong>WHILE(expression)</strong>; <br/>
  </p>

  <p>The UNTIL expression is evaluated at the bottom of the DO loop, so the DO loop always
     executes at least once. The WHILE expression is evaluated before the execution of the DO loop.
     So, if the condition is not true, the DO loop never executes.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 7 -->
  <h2 class="topic" id="topic7">Creating Samples</h2>
  
  <p>Because it performs iterative processing, a DO loop provides an easy way to draw sample
     observations from a data set. For example, suppose you would like to sample every tenth
     observation of the 5,000 observations in <strong>Factory.Widgets</strong>. Start with a simple DATA step:
  </p>
  <pre>
  data work.subset;
     set factory.widgets;
  run;</pre>
  
  <p>You can create the sample data set by enclosing the SET statement in a DO loop. Use the start,
     stop, and increment values to select every tenth observation of the 5,000. Add the POINT= option
     to the SET statement, setting the POINT= option equal to the index variable that is used in the
     DO loop. (You learned about the POINT= option in Chapter, <strong>Reading SAS Data Sets</strong>.)
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.subset;
     do sample=10 to 5000 by 10;
        set factory.widgets point=sample;
     end;
  run;</pre>

  <p>Remember that, in order to prevent continuous DATA step looping, you need to add a STOP
     statement when using the POINT= option. Then, because the STOP statement prevents the
     output of observations at the end of the DATA step, you also need to add an OUTPUT statement.
  </p>

  <p>Place the statement inside the DO loop in order to output each observation that is selected. (If the
     OUTPUT statement were placed after the DO loop, only the last observation would be written.)
  </p>

  <pre>
  data work.subset;
     do sample=10 to 5000 by 10;
        set factory.widgets point=sample;
        output;
     end;
     stop;
  run;</pre>

  <p>When the program runs, the DATA step reads the observations that are identified by the POINT=
     option in Factory.Widgets. The values of the POINT= option are provided by the DO loop, which
     starts at 10 and goes to 5,000 in increments of 10. The data set Work.Subset contains 500
     observations.

  <!-- Topic 8 Subtopic 1-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic8_subtopic1">Text Summary</h3>

  <h4>Purpose of DO Loops</h4>
  <p>DO loops process groups of SAS statements repeatedly, reducing the number of statements that
     are required in repetitive calculations.
  </p>

  <h4>Syntax of Iterative DO Loops</h4>
  <p>To construct an iterative DO loop, specify an index variable and the conditions that will execute
     the loop. These conditions include a start value for the index variable, a stop value, and an
     increment value. Start, stop, and increment values can be any number, numeric variable, or SAS
     expression that results in a number.
  </p>

  <h4>DO Loop Execution</h4>
  <p>During each iteration of a DO loop, new values are created in the SAS program data vector.
     When the loop's index value exceeds the stop value, the DO loop stops, and processing
     continues with the following DATA step statement.
  </p>

  <h4>Counting DO Loop Iterations</h4>
  <p>A simple way to track DO loop iterations is to create a temporary counting variable, then drop this
     variable from the data set. Or, include an OUTPUT statement within the DO loop to write an
     observation for each iteration. This overrides the automatic generation of output at the end of the
     DATA step.
  </p>

  <h4>Decrementing DO Loops</h4>
  <p>You can decrement a DO loop by specifying a negative value for the BY clause. The start value
     must be greater than the stop value.
  </p>

  <h4>Specifying a Series of Items</h4>
  <p>You can specify how many times a DO loop executes by listing items in a series; the DO loop will
     execute once for each item, with the index variable equal to the value of each item. A series can
     consist of all numeric values, all character values (enclosed in quotation marks), or all variable
     names (without quotation marks).
  </p>

  <h4>Nesting DO Loops</h4>
  <p>DO loops can run within DO loops, as long as you assign a unique index variable to each loop
     and terminate each DO loop with its own END statement.
  </p>

  <h4>Iteratively Processing Data That Is Read from a Data Set</h4>
  <p>You can use a DO loop to read a data set and compute the value of a new variable. DO loop start
     and stop values, for example, can be read from a data set.
  </p>

  <h4>Conditionally Executing DO Loops</h4>
  <p>The <strong>DO UNTIL</strong> statement executes a DO loop until a condition is true. Because the expression is
     not evaluated until the bottom of the loop, a DO UNTIL loop will execute at least once. The <strong>DO
     WHILE</strong> statement is used to execute a DO loop while a condition is true. Because the DO WHILE
     statement is evaluated at the top of the DO loop, if the expression is false the first time it is
     evaluated, then the DO loop never executes.
  </p>

  <h4>Using Conditional Clauses within Iterative DO Statements</h4>
  <p>DO WHILE and DO UNTIL statements can be used within iterative DO loops to combine
     conditional and unconditional execution.
  </p>

  <h4>Creating Samples</h4>
  <p>DO loops provide an easy way to create samples from other data sets. Enclose the SET
     statement in a DO loop, using the start, stop, and increment values to select the observations.
     Add the POINT= option to the SET statement, setting it equal to the index variable of the DO
     loop. Then add a STOP statement to prevent DATA step looping, and add an OUTPUT statement
     to write DATA step output.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 8 Subtopic 2-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic8_subtopic2">Points to Remember</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If you do not specify a BY clause, then the increment value for DO loops is 1</li>
    <li>In most cases, the index variable is needed only for processing the DO loop and can be
        dropped from the data set
    </li>
    <li>The index variable is always incremented by one value beyond the stop value unless you
        terminate the DO loop in some other manner
    </li>
    <li>It's easier to manage nested DO loops if you indent the statements in each loop</li>
    <li>In order for nested DO loops to execute correctly, you must
        <ul>
           <li>assign a unique index-variable name in each iterative DO statement</li>
           <li>end each DO loop with an END statement</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
