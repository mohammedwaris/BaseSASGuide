  <p>Before discussing how to edit and debug programs, let's review the characteristics of SAS
     statements and look at enhancing the readability of your SAS programs.
  </p>
  <p>Remember that SAS programs consist of SAS statements.</p>
  <p><strong>SAS statements.....</strong></p>
  <img src="images/ch3_image2.png" class="diagram"/>

  <p>Although you can write SAS statements in almost any format, a consistent layout enhances
     readability and helps you understand the program's purpose. It's a good idea to
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>begin DATA and PROC steps in column one.</li>
    <li>indent statements within a step.</li>
    <li>begin RUN statements in column one.</li>
    <li>include a RUN statement after every DATA step or PROC step.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic3">Interpreting Error Messages</h2>

  <!-- Topic 3 Subtopic 1 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic3_subtopic1">Error Types</h3>

  <p>So far, the programs that you've seen in this book have been error free, but programming errors
     do occur. SAS can detect several types of errors. The most common are
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>syntax errors</strong> that occur when program statements do not conform to the rules of the
        SAS language
    </li>
    <li><strong>data errors</strong> that occur when some data values are not appropriate for the SAS
        statements that are specified in a program.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This chapter focuses on identifying and correcting <strong>syntax errors</strong>.</p>

  <!-- Topic 3 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic3_subtopic2">Syntax Errors</h3>

  <p>When you submit a program, SAS scans each step for syntax errors, then processes the step (if
     no syntax errors are found). SAS then goes to the next step and repeats the process. Syntax
     errors, such as misspelled words, generally cause SAS to stop processing the step in which the
     error occurred.
  </p>
  <p>You already know that information is written to the SAS log while a SAS program is executing.
     When a program that contains an error is submitted, messages regarding the problem also
     appear in the SAS log. When a syntax error is detected, the SAS log
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>displays the word ERROR.</li>
    <li>identifies the possible location of the error.</li>
    <li>gives an explanation of the error.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>

  <h4>Example</h4>

  <p>The program below contains a syntax error. The DATA step copies the SAS data set
     <strong>Clinic.Admit</strong> into a new data set named <strong>Clinic.Admitfee</strong>. The PROC step should print the
     values for the variables <i>ID</i>, <i>Name</i>, <i>Actlevel</i>, and <i>Fee</i> in the new data set. However, <i>print</i> is
     misspelled in the PROC PRINT statement.
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">
  <pre>
  data clinic.admitfee;
     set clinic.admit;
  run;
  proc prin data=clinic.admitfee;
     var id name actlevel fee;
  run;</pre>
  </div>

  <p>When the program is submitted, messages in the SAS log indicate that the procedure PRIN was
     not found and that SAS stopped processing the PRINT step due to errors. No output is produced
     by the PRINT procedure, because the second step fails to execute.
  </p>

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic4">Correcting Errors</h2>

  <p>To modify programs that contain errors, you can edit them in the Editor window. You can correct
     simple errors, such as the spelling error in the following program, by typing over the incorrect text,
     deleting text, or inserting text.
  </p>

     the PROC PRINT statement.

  <!-- Topic 4 Subtopic 1 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic4_subtopic1">Resubmitting a Revised Program</h3>

  <p>After correcting your program, you can submit it again.</p>
  <p>Previously, because there was an error in the PRINT procedure, the code that contained the error
     did not produce output. This time, the PRINT procedure executes and produces output.

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic5">Resolving Common Problems</h2>

  <p>In addition to correcting spelling mistakes, you might need to resolve several other types of
     common syntax errors. These errors include
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>omitting semicolons.</li>
    <li>leaving quotation marks unbalanced.</li>
    <li>specifying invalid options.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Another common problem is omitting a RUN statement at the end of a program. Although this is
     not technically an error, it can produce unexpected results. For the sake of convenience, we'll
     consider it together with syntax errors.
  </p>
  <p>The table below lists these problems and their symptoms.</p>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic1">Missing RUN Statement</h3>

  <p>Each step in a SAS program is compiled and executed independently from every other step. As a
     step is compiled, SAS recognizes the end of the current step when it encounte
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a DATA or PROC statement, which indicates the beginning of a new step.</li>
    <li>a RUN or QUIT statement, which indicates the end of the current step.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When the program below is submitted, the DATA step executes, but the PROC step does not.
     The PROC step does not execute because there is no following DATA or PROC step to indicate
     the beginning of a new step, nor is there a following RUN statement to indicate the end of the
     step.
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">

  <!-- Topic 5 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic2">Missing Semicolon</h3>

  <p>One of the most common errors is the omission of a semicolon at the end of a statement. The
     program below is missing a semicolon at the end of the PROC PRINT statement.
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">

  <p>When you omit a semicolon, SAS reads the statement that lacks the semicolon, plus the following
     statement, as one long statement. The SAS log then lists errors that relate to the combined
     statement, not the actual mistake (the missing semicolon).

  <p>To correct the error, do the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Find the statement that lacks a semicolon. You can usually locate the statement that
        lacks the semicolon by looking at the underscored keywords in the error message and
        working backwards.
    </li>
    <li>Add a semicolon in the appropriate location.</li>
    <li>Resubmit the corrected program.</li>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic3">Unbalanced Quotation Marks</h3>

  <p>Some syntax errors, such as the missing quotation mark after <i>HIGH</i> in the program below, cause
     SAS to misinterpret the statements in your program.
  </p>

  run;</pre>
  </div>

  <p>When you have unbalanced quotation marks, SAS is often unable to detect the end of the
     statement in which the error occurs. When the program above is submitted, SAS is unable to
     resolve the DATA step, and a "DATA STEP running" message appears at the top of the active
     window.
  </p>
  <p>In addition, when unbalanced quotation marks appear in a program that contains TITLE or
     FOOTNOTE statements, there is sometimes a warning in the SAS log which indicates that
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>a text string enclosed in quotation marks has become too long.</li>
    <li>a statement that contains quotation marks (such as a TITLE or FOOTNOTE statement) is
        ambiguous due to invalid options or unquoted text.

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic4">Invalid Option</h3>

  <p>An <strong>invalid option</strong> error occurs when you specify an option that is not valid in a particular
     statement. In the program below, the KEYLABEL option is not valid when used with the PROC
     PRINT statement.
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">
  <pre>
  data clinic.admitfee;
     set clinic.admit;
  run;
  proc print data=clinic.admitfee keylabel;
     label actlevel='Activity Level';
  run;</pre>
  </div>

  <p>When a SAS statement that contains an invalid option is submitted, a message appears in the
     SAS log indicating that there is a syntax error. The message lists the options that are valid in the
     statement.

  <h4>Resolving the Problem</h4>
  <p>To correct the error:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove or replace the invalid option, and check your statement syntax as needed.</li>
    <li>Resubmit the corrected program.</li>
    <li>Check the SAS log again to make sure there are no other errors.</li>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic1">Comments in SAS Programs</h3>

  <p>You can insert comments into a SAS program to document the purpose of the program, to
     explain segments of the program, or to describe the steps in a complex program or calculation. A
     comment statement begins and ends with a comment symbol. There are two forms of comment
     statements:
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">
  <pre>*text;</pre>
  </div>

  <p>or</p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">
  <pre>/*text*/</pre>
  </div>

  <p>SAS ignores text in comments during processing.</p>
  <p>The following program shows some of the ways comments can be used to describe a SAS
     program.
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">
  <pre>
  /* Read national sales data for vans */
  /* from an external raw data file */
  data perm.vansales;
     infile vandata;
     input @1 Region $9.
           @13 Quarter 1. /* Values are 1, 2, 3, or 4 */
           @16 TotalSales comma11.;
  /* Print the entire data set */
  proc print data=perm.vansales;
  run;</pre>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic2">SAS System Options</h3>

  <p>SAS includes several system options that enable you to control error handling and SAS log
     messages. The table shown below contains brief descriptions of some of these options. You can
     use the OPTIONS statement to specify these options.
  </p>

  <div class="scrolling-div">
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th class="color-red">Options</th>
      <th class="color-red">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ERRORS=n</td>
      <td>Specifies the maximum number of observations for which complete data error messages are printed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FMTERR | NOFMTERR</td>
      <td>Controls whether SAS generates an error message when a format of
          a variable cannot be found. NOFMTERR results in a warning instead
          of an error. FMTERR is the default.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SOURCE | NOSOURCE</td>
      <td>Controls whether SAS writes source statements to the SAS log. SOURCE is the default.</td>

  <h4>SAS Program Layout</h4>
  <p>SAS programs consist of SAS statements. Although you can write SAS statements in almost any
     format, a consistent layout enhances readability and enables you to understand the program's
     purpose.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h4>Interpreting Error Messages</h4>
  <p>When a SAS program that contains errors is submitted, error messages appear in the SAS log.
     SAS can detect several types of errors, including syntax and data errors. This chapter focuses on
     identifying and resolving common syntax errors.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h4>Correcting Errors</h4>
  <p>To modify a program that contains syntax errors, you can correct the errors in the Editor window
     and then resubmit the revised program. You can delete any error-free steps from a revised
     program before resubmitting it.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h4>Detecting and Resolving Common Problems</h4>
  <p>You might need to resolve several types of common problems: missing RUN statements, missing
     semicolons, unbalanced quotation marks, and invalid options.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic7_subtopic2">Points to Remember</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It's a good idea to begin DATA steps, PROC steps, and RUN statements on the left and to indent statements within a step.</li>
    <li>End each step with a RUN statement.</li>
    <li>Review the messages in the SAS log each time you submit a SAS program.</li>
  </ul>
