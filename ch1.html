  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic1_subtopic1">Introduction</h3>
  <p>To program effectively using SAS, you need to understand basic concepts about <b>SAS programs</b>
     and the <b>SAS files</b> that they process. in particular, you need to be familiar with <b>SAS data sets</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     In this chapter, you'll examine a simple SAS program and see how it works. You'll see how SAS 
     data sets are stored temporily or permanently in <b>SAS libraries</b>. You'll also learn details about 
     SAS data sets, which are files that contain data that is logically arranged in a form that SAS can 
     understand.

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic2">SAS Programs</h2>
  <p>
     You can use SAS programs to access, manage, analyze, or present your data. Let's begin by
     looking at a simple SAS program.

     <pre>
     data clinic.admit2;
       set clinic.admit;
     run;
     proc print data = clinic.admit2;
     run;</pre>
     
     This program creates a new SAS data set  from an existing SAS data set and then print a listing 
     of the new data set. A SAS data set is a data file that is formatted in a way that SAS can understand.
  </p>

  <p>Let's see how this program works.</p>
  
  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 1 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic1">Components of SAS Programs</h3>
  <p>our sample SAS program contains two steps: a <b>DATA step</b> and a <b>PROC step</b>.</p>
  <pre>
    data clinic.admit2;
      set clinic.admit;
    run;
    proc print data = clinic.admit2;
    run;</pre>
  <p>These two types of steps, alone or combined, form most SAS programs.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
       <td><img src="images/ch1_image2.png" /></td>
       <td>A SAS program can consist of a DATA step</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
       <td><img src="images/ch1_image3.png" /></td> 
       <td>or a PROC step</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td><img src="images/ch1_image2.png" /></td>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/ch1_image3.png" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
     <b>DATA steps</b> typically create or modify SAS data sets. They can also be used to produce custom 
        designed reports. For example, you can use DATA steps to
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>put your data into a SAS data set</li>
    <li>compute values</li>
    <li>check for and correct errors in your data</li>
    <li>produce new SAS data sets by subsetting, merging and updating existing data sets</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
     <b>PROC(procedure) steps</b> are pre-written routines that enable you to analyze and process the 
     data in a SAS data set and to present the data in the form of a report. PROC steps sometimes 
     create new SAS data sets that contain the results of the procedure. PROC steps can list, sort, 
     and summarize data. For example, you can use PROC steps to 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>create a report that lists the data</li>
    <li>produce descriptive statistics</li>
    <li>create a summary report</li>
    <li>produce plots and charts</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic2">Characteristics of SAS Programs</h3>
  <p>
    Next let's look at the individual statement in our sample program. SAS programs consists of <b>SAS statements</b>.
    A SAS statement has two important characteristics:  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It usually begins with a SAS <b>keyword</b></li>
    <li>It always ends with a <b>semicolon</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As you've seen, a DATA step begins with a DATA statement, which begins with the keyword 
    DATA. A PROC step begins with a PROC statement, which begins with the keywod PROC. Our 
    sample program contains <b>(1)</b> a DATA statement, <b>(2)</b> a SET statement, 
    <b>(3)</b> a RUN statement, <b>(4)</b> a PROC PRINT statement and <b>(5)</b> another RUN statement.

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic3">Layout for SAS Programs</h3>
  <p>SAS statements are in free format. This means that</p>
  <ul>
    <li>they can begin and end anywhere on a line</li>
    <li>one statment can continue over several lines</li>
    <li>several statements can be on a line</li>

  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 4 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic4">Processing SAS programs</h3>
  <p>
    When you submit a SAS program, SAS begins reading the statements and checking them for errors.
    <br/><br/>
    DATA and PROC statements signal the begining of a new step. When SAS encounters a subsequent DATA, 
    PROC or RUN statement(for DATA steps and most procedures) or a QUIT statement(for some procedures), 
    SAS stops reading statements and executes the previous step in the program. In our sample program, 
    each step ends with a RUN statement.
  </p>
  <pre>
     data clinic.admit2;
        set clinic.admit;
     run;
     proc print data = clinic.admit2;
     run;
  </pre>

  <table class="note-table">
    <tr>
      <th class="color-blue">Note</th>
      <td>The begining of a new step(DATA or PROC) implies the end of the previous step. Though the RUN statement is not always required between steps in a SAS programs, using it can make the SAS program easier to read and debug, and it makes the SAS log easier to read.</td>

  <!-- Topic 2 Subtopic 5 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic2_subtopic5">Log Messages</h3>
  <p> 
    Each time a step is executed, SAS generates a log of the processing activities and the results of 
    the processing. The SAS log collects message about the processing of SAS programs and about any errors that occur.
    <br/><br/>
    When SAS processes our sample program, you see the log messages shown below. Notice that you get separate sets of messages for each step in the program.
  </p>

  <p class="color-red">SAS Log  </p>

  <pre>

        21 observations and 9 variables.

  <h2 class="topic" id="topic3">SAS Libraries</h2>
  <p>You've learned about SAS programs and SAS data sets. Now let's look at SAS libraries to see how SAS data sets and other SAS files are organized and stored.</p>

  <!-- Topic 3 Subtopic 1-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic3_subtopic1">How SAS Files are Stored</h3>
  <p>
     Every SAS file is stored in a <strong>SAS library</strong>, which is a collection of SAS files. 
     A SAS data library is the highest level of organization for information within SAS.
     <br/><br/>
     SAS libraries have different implementations depending on your operating environment, but a
     library usually corresponds to the level of organization that your host operating system uses to
     access and store files. In some operating environments, a library is a physical collection of files.
     In others, the files are only logically related.
     <br/><br/>
     For example, in the Windows and UNIX environments, a library is typically a group of SAS files in
     the same folder or directory.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image4.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  
  <p>
    The table below summarizes the implementation of SAS libraries in various operating environments.

           a group of SAS files that are stored in the same directory. Other
           files can be stored in the directory, but only the files that have
           SAS file extensions are recognized as part of the SAS library.
           (Refer to the online documentation for more information.)

  <!-- Topic 3 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic3_subtopic2">Storing Files Temporarily or Permanently</h3>

  <p>Depending on the library name that you use when you create a file, you can store SAS files
     temporarily or permanently.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image5.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>
     Temporary SAS libraries last only for the current SAS session.
     <br/><br/>
     <strong>Storing files temporarily:</strong>
     <br/><br/>
     If you don't specify a library name when you create a file (or if you specify the library name
     <strong>Work</strong>), the file is stored in the temporary SAS data library. When you end the session, the
     temporary library and all of its files are deleted.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image6.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>Permanent SAS libraries are available to you during subsequent SAS sessions.
     <br/><br/>
     <strong>Storing files permanently:</strong>
     <br/><br/>
     To store files permanently in a SAS data library, you specify a library name other than the default
     library name <strong>Work</strong>.
     <br/><br/>
     For example, by specifying the library name Clinic when you create a file, you specify that the file
     is to be stored in a permanent SAS data library until you delete it.

    In the two-level name, <strong>libref</strong> is the name of the SAS data library that contains the file, and
    <strong>filename</strong> is the name of the file itself. A period separates the libref and filename.
  </p>

  <!-- Page 15 -->
  <img src="images/ch1_image7.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>For example, in our sample program, <strong>Clinic.Admit</strong> is the two-level name for the 
     SAS data set <strong>Admit</strong>, which is stored in the library named <strong>Clinic</strong>.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image8.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <!-- Topic 4 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic4_subtopic2">Referencing Temporary SAS Files</h3>
  <p>To reference temporary SAS files, you can specify the default libref <strong>Work</strong>, a 
     period, and the filename. For example, the two-level name <strong>Work.Test</strong> references 
     the SAS data set named <strong>Test</strong> that is stored in the temporary SAS library <strong>Work</strong>.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image9.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>Alternatively, you can use a <strong>one-level name</strong> (the filename only) to reference a file in a temporary
     SAS library. When you specify a one-level name, the default libref <strong>Work</strong> is assumed. For
     example, the one-level name <strong>Test</strong> also references the SAS data set named <strong>Test</strong> that is stored in
     the temporary SAS library <strong>Work</strong>.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image10.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <table class="info-table">
    <tr>
      <th class="color-blue">Info</th>
      <td>If the USER library is assigned, SAS uses the <strong>User</strong> library rather than the 
          <strong>Work</strong> library for one-level names. <strong>User</strong> is a permanent library.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <!-- Topic 4 Subtopic 3 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic4_subtopic3">Referencing Permanent SAS Files</h3>
  <p>You can see that <strong>Clinic.Admit</strong> and <strong>Clinic.Admit2</strong> are permanent SAS data sets because the
     library name is <strong>Clinic</strong>, not <strong>Work</strong>.
  </p>

  <!-- Page 16 -->

  <img src="images/ch1_image11.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <br/>
  <p>
     So referencing a SAS file in any library <strong>except Work</strong> indicates that the SAS file is stored
     permanently. For example, when our sample program creates <strong>Clinic.Admit2</strong>, it stores the new
     <strong>Admit2</strong> data set permanently in the SAS library <strong>Clinic</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>SAS data set names</p>
  <ul>
    <li>can be 1 to 32 characters long</li>
    <li>must begin with a letter (A-Z, either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_)</li>

  <!-- Topic 5 -->
  <h2 class="topic" id="topic5">SAS Data Sets</h2>

  <p>So far, you've seen the components and characteristics of SAS programs, including how they
     reference SAS data sets. Data sets are one type of SAS file. There are other types of SAS files
     (such as catalogs), but this chapter focuses on SAS data sets. For many procedures and for
     some DATA step statements, data must be in the form of a SAS data set to be processed. Now
     let's take a closer look at SAS data sets.
  </p>
  
  <!-- Topic 5 Subtopic 1 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic1">Overview of Data Sets</h3>
  <p>As you saw in our sample program, for many of the data processing tasks that you perform with
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>access data in the form of a SAS data set</li>
    <li>analyze, manage, or present the data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Conceptually, a SAS data set is a file that consists of two parts: a <strong>descriptor portion</strong> and a <strong>data
    portion</strong>. Sometimes a SAS data set also points to one or more indexes, which enable SAS to
    locate records in the data set more efficiently. (The data sets that you see in this chapter do not
    contain indexes.)
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image12.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <!-- Page 17 -->
  
  <!-- Topic 5 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic2">Descriptor Portion</h3>
  
  <p>The descriptor portion of a SAS data set contains information about the data set, including</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the name of the data set</li>
    <li>the date and time that the data set was created</li>
    <li>the number of observations</li>
    <li>the number of variables</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's look at another SAS data set. The table below lists part of the descriptor portion of the data
     set <strong>Clinic.Insure</strong>, which contains insurance information for patients who are admitted to a
     wellness clinic. (It's a good idea to give your data set a name that is descriptive of the contents.)
  </p>
  <pre>
  Data Set Name:      CLINIC.INSURE
  Member Type:        DATA
  Engine:             V8
  Created:            10:05 Tuesday, March 30, 1999
  Observations:       21
  Variables:          7
  Indexes:            0
  Observation Length: 64
  </pre>

  <!-- Topic 5 Subtopic 3 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic3">Data Portion</h3>

  <p>The data portion of a SAS data set is a collection of data values that are arranged in a
     rectangular table. In the example below, the name Jones is a data value, the weight 158.3 is a
     data value, and so on.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image13.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <!-- Topic 5 Subtopic 4 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic5_subtopic4">Observations (Rows)</h3>

  <p><strong>Rows</strong> (called <strong>observations</strong>) in the data set are collections of data values that usually relate to a
     single object. The values Jones, M, 48, and 128.6 constitute a single observation in the data set
     shown below.
  </p>


  <!-- Topic 6 -->
  <h2 class="topic" id="topic6">Variable Attributes</h2>
  <p>
      In addition to general information about the data set, the descriptor portion contains information
     about the attributes of each variable in the data set. The attribute information includes the
     variable's name, type, length, format, informat, and label.
     <br/><br/>
     When you write SAS programs, it's important to understand the attributes of the variables that
     you use. For example, you might need to combine SAS data sets that contain same-named
     variables. In this case, the variables must be the same type (character or numeric).
     <br/><br/>
     The following is a partial listing of the attribute information in the descriptor portion of the SAS
     data set <strong>Clinic.Insure</strong>. Let's look at the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>type</strong>, and <strong>length</strong> variable attributes. You'll learn
     about the format, informat, and label attributes later in this chapter.
  </p>
  <pre>
  Variable Type Length Format    Informat Label

  Policy   Num  8                         Policy Number
  Total    Num  8      DOLLAR8.2 COMMA10. Total Balance
  Name     Char 20                        Patient Name
  </pre>

  <!-- Page 18 -->

  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 1-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic1">Name</h3>
  <p>Each variable has a name that conforms to SAS naming conventions. Variable names follow
     exactly the same rules as SAS data set names. Like data set names, variable names
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>can be 1 to 32 characters long</li>
    <li>must begin with a letter (A-Z, either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_)</li>
    <li>can continue with any combination of numbers, letters, or underscores</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/ch1_image14.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 2-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic2">Type</h3>
  <p>A variable's type is either <strong>character</strong> or <strong>numeric</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Character variables, such as Name (shown below), can contain <strong>any values</strong></li>
    <li>Numeric variables, such as Policy and Total (shown below), can contain <strong>only
        numeric values</strong> (the digits 0 through 9, +, -, ., and E for scientific notation).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/ch1_image15.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <p>A variable's type determines how missing values for a variable are displayed. In the following
     data set, Name and Sex are character variables, and Age and Weight are numeric variables.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For character variables such as Name, a <strong>blank</strong> represents a missing value</li>
    <li>For numeric variables such as Age, a <strong>period</strong> represents a missing value</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="div-scroll-content">
  <table border="1">

  <!-- Page 19 -->


  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 3-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic3">Length</h3>
  <p>A variable's <strong>length</strong> (the number of bytes used to store it) is related to its type.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Character variables can be up to <strong>32,767 bytes</strong> long. In the example below, Name has a
        length of 20 characters and uses 20 bytes of storage
    </li>
    <li>All numeric variables have a default length of <strong>8</strong>. Numeric values (no matter how many
        digits they contain) are stored as floating-point numbers in 8 bytes of storage, unless you
        specify a different length
    </li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/ch1_image16.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>
     You've seen that each SAS variable has a name, type, and length. In addition, you can define
     <strong>format</strong>, <strong>informat</strong>, and <strong>label</strong> attributes for variables. Let's look briefly at these optional
     attributes- you'll learn more about them in later chapters as you need to use them.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 4-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic4">Format</h3>
  <p>Formats are variable attributes that affect the way data values are written. SAS software offers a
     variety of character, numeric, and date and time formats. You can also create and store your own
     formats. To write values out using a particular form, you select the appropriate format.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image17.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>For example, to display the value 1234 as $1234.00 in a report, you can use the DOLLAR8.2
     format, as shown for Total below.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image18.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>Usually you have to specify the maximum width (<strong>w</strong>) of the value to be written. Depending on the
     particular format, you might also need to specify the number of decimal places (d) to be written.
     For example, to display the value 5678 as 5,678.00 in a report, you can use the COMMA8.2
     format, which specifies a width of 8 including 2 decimal places.
  </p>

  <!-- Page 20 -->

  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 5-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic5">Informat</h3>

  <p>Whereas <strong>formats</strong> write values <strong>out</strong> by using some particular form, <strong>informats</strong> read data values in
     certain forms <strong>into</strong> standard SAS values. Informats determine how data values are read into a
     SAS data set. You <strong>must</strong> use informats to read numeric values that contain letters or other special
     characters.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image19.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>For example, the numeric value $1,234.00 contains two special characters, a dollar sign ($) and a
     comma (,). You can use an informat to read the value while removing the dollar sign and comma,
     and then store the resulting value as a standard numeric value. For Total below, the
     COMMA10. informat is specified.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image20.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>

  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 6-->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic6">Label</h3>

  <p>A variable can have a <strong>label</strong>, which consists of descriptive text up to 256 characters long. By
     default, many reports identify variables by their names. You might want to display more
     descriptive information about the variable by assigning a label to the variable.
     <br/><br/>
     For example, you can label Policy as <strong>Policy Number</strong>, Total as <strong>Total Balance</strong>, and Name as
     <strong>Patient Name</strong> to display these labels in reports.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image21.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>You might even want to use labels to shorten long variable names in your reports. Assigning
     labels to variables is discussed in Chapter, Creating List Reports.
  </p>

  <!-- Page 21 -->

  <img src="images/ch1_image22.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>This data set has four observations, each containing information about an individual. A SAS data
     set can store any number of observations.     
  </p>
  
  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 7 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic7">Variables (Columns)</h3>

  <p><strong>Columns</strong> (called <strong>variables</strong>) in the data set are collections of values that describe a particular
     characteristic. The values Jones, Laverne, Jaffe, and Wilson constitute the variable Name in the
     data set shown below.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch1_image23.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
  <p>
    This data set contains four variables for each observation: Name, Sex, Age, and Weight. A
    SAS data set can store thousands of variables.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 6 Subtopic 8 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic6_subtopic8">Missing Values</h3>

  <p>The rectangular arrangement of rows and columns in a SAS data set implies that every variable
     must exist for each observation. If a data value is unknown for a particular observation, a missing
     value is recorded in the SAS data set.</p>

  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic7_subtopic1">Text Summary</h3>

  <h4>Components of SAS Programs</h4>
  <p><strong>SAS programs</strong> consist of two types of steps: DATA steps and PROC (procedure) steps. These
     two steps, alone or combined, form most SAS programs. A SAS program can consist of a DATA
     step, a PROC step, or any combination of DATA and PROC steps. <strong>DATA steps</strong> typically create
     or modify SAS data sets, but they can also be used to produce custom-designed reports. <strong>PROC
     steps</strong> are pre- written routines that enable you to analyze and process the data in a SAS data set
     and to present the data in the form of a report. PROC steps sometimes create new SAS data sets
     that contain the results of the procedure.
  </p>

  <h4>Characteristics of SAS Programs</h4>
  <p>SAS programs consist of <strong>SAS statements</strong>. A SAS statement usually begins with a SAS keyword
     and always ends with a semicolon. A DATA step begins with the keyword DATA. A PROC step
     begins with the keyword PROC. SAS statements are in free format, so they can begin and end
     anywhere on a line. One statement can continue over several lines, and several statements can
     be on a line. Blanks or special characters separate "words" in a SAS statement.
  </p>

  <h4>Processing SAS Programs</h4>
  <p>When you submit a SAS program, SAS reads SAS statements and checks them for errors. When
     it encounters a subsequent DATA, PROC, RUN, or QUIT statement, SAS executes the previous
     step in the program.
     <br/><br/>
     Each time a step is executed, SAS generates a log of the processing activities and the results of
     the processing. The SAS log collects messages about the processing of SAS programs and
     about any errors that occur.
     <br/><br/>
     The results of processing can vary. Some SAS programs open an interactive window or invoke
     procedures that create output in the form of a report. Other SAS programs perform tasks such as
     sorting and managing data, which have no visible results other than messages in the log.
  </p>

  <h4>SAS Libraries</h4>
  <p>Every SAS file is stored in a <strong>SAS library</strong>, which is a collection of SAS files such as SAS data sets
     and catalogs. In some operating environments, a SAS library is a physical collection of files. In
     others, the files are only logically related. In the Windows and UNIX environments, a SAS library
     is typically a group of SAS files in the same folder or directory.
     <br/><br/>
     Depending on the libref you use, you can store SAS files in temporary SAS libraries or in
     permanent SAS libraries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Temporary SAS files that are created during the session are held in a special workspace
        that is assigned the default libref <strong>Work</strong>. If you don't specify a libref when you create a file (or
        if you specify <strong>Work</strong>), then the file is stored in the temporary SAS library. When you end the
        session, the temporary library is deleted
    </li>
    <li>To store a file permanently in a SAS library, you assign it a libref other than the default
        <strong>Work</strong>. For example, by assigning the libref <strong>Clinic</strong> to a SAS library, you specify that files
        within the library are to be stored until you delete them
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Page 23 -->

  <h4>Referencing SAS Files</h4>
  <p>To reference a SAS file, you use a two-level name, <strong>libref.filename</strong>. In the two-level name, <strong>libref</strong>
     is the name for the SAS library that contains the file, and filename is the name of the file itself. A
     period separates the libref and filename.
     <br/><br/>
     To reference temporary SAS files, you specify the default libref <strong>Work</strong>, a period, and the filename.
     Alternatively, you can simply use a one-level name (the filename only) to reference a file in a
     temporary SAS library. Referencing a SAS file in any library <strong>except Work</strong> indicates that the SAS
     file is stored permanently.
     <br/><br/>
     SAS data set names can be 1 to 32 characters long, must begin with a letter (A-Z, either
     uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_), and can continue with any combination of
     numbers, letters, or underscores.
  </p>

  <h4>Overview of SAS Data Sets</h4>
  <p>For many of the data processing tasks that you perform with SAS, you access data in the form of
     a <strong>SAS data set</strong> and use SAS programs to analyze, manage, or present the data. Conceptually, a
     SAS data set is a file that consists of two parts: a descriptor portion and a data portion. Some
     SAS data sets also contain one or more indexes, which enable SAS to locate records in the data
     set more efficiently.
     <br/><br/>
     The <strong>descriptor portion</strong> of a SAS data set contains information about the data set.
     <br/><br/>
     The <strong>data portion</strong> of a SAS data set is a collection of data values that are arranged in a
     rectangular table. <strong>Observations</strong> in the data set correspond to rows or data lines in a raw data file
     or in an external database. An observation is the information about each object in a SAS data set.
     <strong>Variables</strong> in the data set correspond to columns in a raw data file or in an external database. A
     variable is the set of data values that describe a particular characteristic. If a data value is
     unknown for a particular observation, a missing value is recorded in the SAS data set.
  </p>

  <h4>Variable Attributes</h4>
  <p>In addition to general information about the data set, the descriptor portion contains attribute
     information for each variable in the data set. The attribute information includes the variable's
     name, length, and type. A variable's type determines how missing values for a variable are
     displayed by SAS. For character variables, a <strong>blank</strong> represents a missing value. For numeric
     variables, a <strong>period</strong> represents a missing value.
  </p>

  <!-- Topic 7 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic7_subtopic2">Points to Remember</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Before referencing SAS files, you must assign a name (libref, or library reference) to the
        library in which the files are stored (or specify that SAS is to assign the name automatically)
    </li>
    <li>You can store SAS files either temporarily or permanently</li>
    <li>Variable names follow the same rules as SAS data set names. However, your site might
        choose to restrict variable names to those valid in SAS Version 6, to uppercase variable
        names automatically, or to remove all restrictions on variable names
    </li>
  </ul>
