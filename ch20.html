  <p>Information for one observation can be spread out over several records. You can write multiple
     INPUT statements to read each record that comprises a single observation, as in this example:
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image1.png" style="max-width:100%"/>

  <p>Or, you can write one INPUT statement that contains a line pointer control to specify the record(s)
     from which values are to be read, as in this example:

  <!-- Topic 1 Subtopic 2 -->
  <h3 class="subtopic" id="topic1_subtopic2">Objectives</h3>

  <p>In this chapter, you learn to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>read multiple records sequentially and create a single observation</li>
    <li>read multiple records non-sequentially and create a single observation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="color-blue">Use Line pointer Controls</h3>
  <p>You know that as SAS reads raw data values, it keeps track of its position with an input pointer.
     You have used column pointer controls and column specifications to determine the column
     placement of the input pointer.
  </p>
  <table border="1">
     <tr>
        <td>Column Specifications</td>
        <td><pre>input Name $ 1-12 Age 15-16 Gender $ 18;</pre></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Column Pointer Controls</td>
        <td><pre>input Name $12. @15 Age 2. @18 Gender $1.;</pre></td>
     </tr>
  </table>

  <p></p>
  <pre>
  </pre>
  <img src="images/ch20_image3.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  

  <p>There are two types of line pointer controls</p>
  <ul>
     <li>The forward slash (/) specifies a line location that is relative to the current one</li>
     <li>The #n specifies the absolute number of the line to which you want to move the pointer</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Page 520 -->

  <p>First we'll look at the forward slash (/). Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to use the #n, and
     you will see how these two controls can be combined.
  </p>
  <h3 class="color-blue"></h3>
  <h3 class="color-red"></h3>
  <p>
     You use the forward slash (/) line pointer control to read multiple records sequentially. The /
     advances the input pointer to the next record. The / line pointer control only moves the input
     pointer forward and must be specified after the instructions for reading the values in the current
     record.
     <br/><br/>
     The single INPUT statement below reads the values for <i>Lname</i> and <i>Fname</i> in the first record,
     followed by the values for <i>Department</i> and <i>JobCode</i> in the second record. Then the value for
     Salary is read in the third record.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image4.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  

  <p>Take a closer look at using the forward slash (/) line pointer control in the following example.</p>
  <p>The raw data file Memdata contains the mailing list of a professional organization. Your task is to
     combine the information for each member into one data set observation. We’ll begin by reading
     each member’s name, followed by the street address, and finally the city, state, and zip code.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>As you write the instructions to read the values for Fname and Lname, notice that not all
        of the values for Lname begin in the same column. So, you should use standard list input
        to read these values
        <img src="images/ch20_image5.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  
    </li>
    <li>Now you want to read the values for Address from the second record. The / line pointer
         control advances the input pointer to the next record. At this point the INPUT statement is
         incomplete, so you should not place a semicolon after the line pointer control
         <img src="images/ch20_image6.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  
    </li>
    <li>You can use column input to read the values in the next record as one variable named
        Address. Then add a line pointer control to move the input pointer to the next record
        <img src="images/ch20_image7.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  
    </li>
    <li>
        As you write the statements to read the values for City, notice that one of the values is
        longer than eight characters and contains embedded blanks. Also note that each value is
        followed by two consecutive blanks. To read these values, you should use modified list
        input with the ampersand (&) modifier.
        <br/><br/>
        The values for State and the values for Zip do not begin in the same column. Therefore,
        you should use list input to read these values
        <img src="images/ch20_image8.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="color-red">Sequential Processing of Multiple Records in the DATA Step</h3>
  <p>Now that you’ve learned the basics of using the / line pointer control, let’s take a closer look at the
     sequential processing of multiple records in the DATA step.
     <br/><br/>
     During compilation, the program data vector is created for the Perm.Members data set. When
     the DATA step executes, the values in the first record are read, and the / line pointer control
     moves the input pointer to the second record.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image9.png" style="max-width:100%"/>  

  <p>The values for Address are read, and the second / line pointer control advances the input pointer
     to the third record.
  </p>

  <!-- Page 522 -->
  <img src="images/ch20_image10.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <p>The values for City, State, and Zip are read, and the INPUT statement is completely executed.</p> 
  <img src="images/ch20_image11.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <p>The values in the program data vector are written to the data set as the first observation.</p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image12.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <p>Control returns to the top of the DATA step, and the variable values are reinitialized to missing.</p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image13.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <p>During the second iteration, values for Fname and Lname are read beginning in column one of
     the fourth record.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image14.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <p>The values for Address are read and the / line pointer control advances the input pointer to the
     fifth record.
  </p>

  <!-- Page 523 -->
  <img src="images/ch20_image15.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 

  <p>The values for City, State, and Zip are read, and the INPUT statement is completely executed.</p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image16.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <img src="images/ch20_image17.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 

  <p>The values in the program data vector are written to the data set as the second observation.</p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image18.png" style="max-width:100%"/> 
  <p>After the data set is complete, PROC PRINT output for Perm.Members shows that a single
     observation contains the complete information for each member.

  <h3 class="color-red">Number of Records per Observation</h3>

  <!-- Page 524 -->

  <p>Note that the raw data file must contain the same number of records for each observation that
     is being created.
  </p>
  <p>For example, suppose there are only two records for the second member. However, the INPUT
     statement is set up to read three records.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image19.png" class="diagram-style" />

  <p>The second member's name and address are read and assigned to corresponding variables.
     Then the input pointer advances to the next record, as directed by the INPUT statement, and the
     third member's name is read as a value for City.
  </p>
  <p>The DATA step is still looking for a value for State and Zip, so the input pointer advances to the
     next record and reads the values for the member's address.
  </p>
  <p>The PROC PRINT output for this data set illustrates the problem.</p>

  <h3 class="color-blue">Reading Multiple Records Non-Sequentially</h3>
  <h3 class="color-red">The #n Line Pointer Control</h3>

  <p>You already know how to read multiple records sequentially by using the / line pointer control.
     Now let's look at reading multiple records non-sequentially by using the #n line pointer control.
  </p>
  <p>The #n specifies the absolute number of the line to which you want to move the input pointer. The
     #n pointer control can read records in any order; therefore, it must be specified before the
     instructions for reading values in a specific record.
  </p>
  <p>The INPUT statement below first reads the values for Department and JobCode in the second
     record, then the values for Lname and Fname in the first record. Finally, it reads the value for
     Salary in the third record.
  </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image21.png" class="diagram-style" />

  <h3>Example: Using the #n Line Pointer Control</h3>
  <p>Take a closer look at using the #n line pointer control in the following example.
   </p>
  <img src="images/ch20_image22.png" class="diagram-style" />

  <p>The raw data file Patdata contains information about the patients of a small group of general
     surgeons.
  </p>
  <p>The first three records contain a patient’s name, address, city, state, and zip code. The fourth
     record contains the patient’s ID number followed by the name of the primary physician.
  </p>
  <p>Suppose you want to read each patient’s information in the following order:</p>
  <ol>
     <li>ID number <i>(ID)</i></li>
     <li>first name <i>(Fname)</i></i></li>
     <li>last name <i>(Lname)</i></li>
     <li>address <i>(Address)</i></li>
     <li>city <i>(City)</i></li>
     <li>state <i>(State)</i></li>
     <li>zip <i>(Zip)</i></li>
     <li>doctor <i>(Doctor)</i></li>
  </ol>

  <!-- Page 526 -->
  <ul>
    <li><p>To read the values for <i>ID</i> in the fourth record, specify #4 before naming the variable and
        defining its attributes.</p>
        <img src="images/ch20_image23.png" class="diagram-style" />
    </li>
    <li><p>To read the values for <i>Fname</i> and <i>Lname</i> in the first record, specify #1 before naming the

    <li><p>Now you need to move the input pointer down to the fourth record to read the values for
           <i>Doctor</i>, which begin in column 7. Don't forget to add a semicolon at the end of the INPUT

  <h3 class="color-blue">Combining Line Pointer Controls</h3>
  <p>The forward slash (/) line pointer control and the #n line pointer control can be used together in a
     SAS program to read multiple records both sequentially and non-sequentially.
  </p>
  <p>For example, you could use both the / line pointer control and the #n line pointer control to read
     the variables in the raw data file Patdata in the following order:

    </li>
    <li>Because the next record to be read is sequential, you can use the / line pointer control

        for <i>Address</i> is read.
    </li>
    <li>The / line pointer control in the next line directs the input pointer to the third record, where
        the values for <i>City</i>, <i>State</i>, and <i>Zip</i> are read.

  <h3 class="color-blue">Summary</h3>
  <h3 class="color-red">Text Summary</h3>

  <h3>Multiple Records Per Observation</h3>
  <p>Information for one observation can be spread out over several records. You can write one
     INPUT statement that contains line pointer controls to specify the records from which values are
     read.
  </p>

  <h3>Reading Multiple Records Sequentially</h3>
  <p>The forward slash (/) line pointer control is used to read multiple records sequentially. Each time a
     / pointer is encountered, the input pointer advances to the next line.
  </p>

  <h3>Reading Multiple Records Non-Sequentially</h3>
  <p>The #n line pointer control is used to read multiple records non-sequentially. The #n specifies the

  <h3>Combining Line Pointer Controls</h3>
  <p>The / line pointer control and the #n line pointer control can be combined within a SAS program to
     read multiple records both sequentially and non-sequentially.
  </p>

  <h3 class="color-red">Points to Remember</h3>
  <ul>
     <li>When a file contains multiple records per observation, the file must contain the same
         number of records for each observation that is being created.
     </li>
     <li>Because the / pointer control can only move forward, the pointer control is specified after
         the values in the current record are read
     </li>
     <li>The #n pointer control can read records in any order and must be specified before the
         variable names are defined.
     </li>
     <li>A semicolon should be placed at the end of the complete INPUT statement.</li>
  </ul>
